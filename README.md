# Inconsistent Firebase onAuthStateChanged Listener

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle bug with Firebase's `onAuthStateChanged` listener.  The listener, in certain scenarios, may not consistently reflect changes in the user's authentication state.  This leads to inconsistencies between the application's UI and the user's actual login status.

## Problem

The `onAuthStateChanged` listener is a crucial part of many Firebase applications. It's used to react to login/logout events and update the application's UI accordingly. However, due to various factors such as network conditions or timing issues, the listener might not fire, leading to incorrect UI rendering and potential data inconsistencies.

## Solution

The provided solution implements more robust error handling and incorporates potential retry mechanisms to mitigate the inconsistencies.  It also provides better logging to assist in debugging the issue.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the necessary packages: `npm install`
3. Run the example using `npm start`.
4. Observe the behavior of the authentication status display and try to trigger a login/logout event multiple times.

## Note

This solution focuses on improving the reliability of the `onAuthStateChanged` listener and doesn't address the root causes of the underlying inconsistencies.
