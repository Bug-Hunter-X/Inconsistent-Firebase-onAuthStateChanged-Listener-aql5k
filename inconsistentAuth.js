The Firebase Authentication SDK's `onAuthStateChanged` listener might not always trigger when the user's authentication state changes. This can happen due to a race condition between the authentication state change and the listener's registration, or due to issues with the underlying Firebase connection.  This leads to an application state that doesn't reflect the actual authentication status. For example, a user might be logged in, but the UI shows they're logged out, or vice-versa.  This is especially problematic in applications relying heavily on real-time updates based on authentication.
